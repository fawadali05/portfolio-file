# Personal Portfolio (Multi-Page)

A responsive, fast, accessible portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — About
- `skills.html` — Skills
- `projects.html` — Projects
- `contact.html` — Contact (client-side validated form)

## How to run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. For best results with routing and assets, use a simple local server:
- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000/`
- VS Code: Live Server extension

## Customize
- Replace images in `assets/images/`
- Update text, links (GitHub/LinkedIn), and meta tags
- Add your projects in `projects.html`

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repository and push this folder.
2. In repo settings → Pages → deploy from `main` branch / root.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
